## Summarised learnings

- React Frontend sends http requests to RESTful API to  instruct the database what needs to get done
- When a request is made to a route/endpoint, the request that was specified is included in the description/value that gets sent to the database as a query
- For requests to edit the endpoints include the identifier `/:poke_id` in the [[URI | software.acronyms.URI ]]
- Data is sent along with these edit requests in JSON format as specified in the header `Content-Type`, together with the intended ID
