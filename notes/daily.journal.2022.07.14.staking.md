The word staking is related to blockchain - an alternative to Proof Of Work 
- miners are called validators
- to add new blocks to blockchain, need to lock up cryptocurrency - this is called Staking
- if they fail to do these things, bad blocks will get produced, and avalidators get penalised

# But in Context of DeFi

- staking refers to investors receiving governance token rewards in exchange for locking up their coins in a smart contract
- this encourages investors to keep it staked and not sell, which is bullish for the price of the token
- technically liq mining and staking are the same, and sometimes these terms are used interchangeably
