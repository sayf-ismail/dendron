## Julien's Notes
- First stablecoin created on Ethereum
- Created by MakerDAO
- To start using it need to create a Vault, fill it with assets to be used as collateral
- DAI is created as a debt, backed by the collateral of the vault
- While holding DAI, need to pay interest aka "stability fee"
- Interest rates determined by Governance of the DAO - this can be slow!

- Collateral-to-dai Ratio = (Collateral amount x Collateral price ) $/$ (Generated DAI * 100) 
- MKR Token - stability fees paid in this token, and used for governance
