## Synchronous
- aka line-by-line
- doing things synchronously means going in sequence

## Asynchronous
- For most tasks in our programs, possible for machines to work on multiple tasks at the same time
- Oftentimes async functions will work in the background while JS has moved on to the next line of code.
- Handling many things side-by-side
