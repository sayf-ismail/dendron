Constants are variables that cannot be modified. Their value is hard coded and using constants can save gas cost.

```solidity

contract Constants {
    // coding convention to uppercase constant variables
    address public constant MY_ADDRESS = 0x777788889999AaAAbBbbCcccddDdeeeEfFFfCcCc;
    uint public constant MY_UINT = 123;
}

```
