## Julien's Notes

No strict definition but:
- Yield Farming means to optimise DeFi investments to get a higher yield
- As a builder of DeFi protocols, it is good to know some techniques to optimise yields in DeFi
- offer more YF opportunities = attract more investors

Advanced Strategies 
- Crop rotation - reallocation of capital across different protocols at different blocks
  - Protocols that do this automatically for you are called **Yield Aggregators**
  - eg Yearn Finance
- Recursive Yield Farming - involves 2 protocols
  - eg Compound (lending protocol) and Curve(dex)
  - Providing LP tokens
