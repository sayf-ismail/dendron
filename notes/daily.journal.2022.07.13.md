- ERC20 tokens can be used as some form of **ownership** in the project
  - eg gives you right to the share of the profit/dividends 
  - similar to company stock
- They can also be used to represent **governance**
  - eg gives you the right to vote for the evolution of the protocol 
  - similar to voting shares in traditional finance
- IOU tokens
  - what you get when you invest other tokens into a protocol
  - can be redeemed against the token initially invested
  - This is the case with LP tokens
  - analogous to games where you can use real fiat to buy virtual money
